# Kuma Engine

## Description

Simple geometry viewer with some UI to visualize some data about the scene and the program itself
 
## Controls

 - w, a, s, d  + Right click to move arround

 - r, f + Right click to go up and down 

 - left mouse click + left alt to rotate

 - shift to accelerate while moving

## Thinks to have in account

For some unknown reason, it cannot load textures.
In the branch Game Object (https://github.com/AlexLA99/Kuma-Engine/tree/GameObject) the windows hierarchy and inspector work, but meshes doesn't render in the screen.
