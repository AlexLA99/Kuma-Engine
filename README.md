# Kuma Engine

## Description

Simple geometry viewer with some UI to visualize some data about the scene and the program itself
 
## Controls

 - w, a, s, d  + Right click to move arround

 - r, f + Right click to go up and down 

 - left mouse click + left alt to rotate

 - shift to accelerate while moving

## Thinks to have in account

Drag and Drop works, but sometimes it doesn't detect it. Just try it again.
For some unknown reason, it cannot load textures.
